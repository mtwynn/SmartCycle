### Description
SmartCycle is an IoT smart trashcan that is capable of sorting and distinguishing between mixed recycling and landfill products.

The entire system consists of a mobile tablet (Android) application that uses Google's Cloud Vision API to analyze a given 
trash item, and a Raspberry Pi that uses these analysis results to actuate the internal hardware that physically moves and
sorts the trash into the respective bins.
